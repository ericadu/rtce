Feedback/documents: Manual tests need to be described in more detail in order to serve as sufficient replacements for automated tests. Design overview could use some more detail. Code and comments are a bit messy.
Feedback/running the software: Various twitches in the multiple users/concurrent case. Possible to get the two editors out of sync, yielding ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException-s. Cursors behave oddly. Otherwise good.
